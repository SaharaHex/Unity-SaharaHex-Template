Exploring the Unity Game Engine for learning and experimentation. This project aims to create an outline template with basic functions that can be adapted for various other projects.

Features so far:
- A simple menu with options to adjust sound levels, screen resolution, and quality settings.
- A pause menu that appears when the game is paused/stopped.
- Basic data saving and loading capabilities.

Although this project is not yet complete and I'm not actively working on it at the moment, it has been an interesting learning experience.
